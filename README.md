# Instagram-Bot
A bot to go through the followers of an Instagram account and compare them to who that account follows

The main purpose is to see who the account follows that does not follow them back. The chrome driver is required for it to run.

Because the Instagram API does not allow for the names of followers to be pulled, only the amount, going through the list in an automated fashion was the most efficient way.
